* Two wrongs don't make a right.

* The pen is mightier than the sword.

* No man is an island.
* When in Rome, do as the Romans.

* The squeaky wheel gets the grease.

* When the going gets tough, the tough get going.

* Fortune favors the bold. 

* People who live in glass houses should not throw stones.

* A picture is worth a thousand words.
